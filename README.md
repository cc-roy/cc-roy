I am a data professional with 10+ years of experience in data science, engineering, and analytics. My specialty lies within app and web environments, with a focus on instrumentation, modeling, pipelines, experimentation, optimization and visualization.

My recent work has focused on the full-stack development of a conversational business intelligence and data analysis application that can answer natural language prompts via large language models like Claude and Gemini. Outside of this work, I have experience with a number of tools, such as GA4, GTM, Segment, Airbyte, DBT, Airflow, BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, Clickhouse, S3, Tableau, and Looker. Further, I possess applied knowledge of a variety of machine learning and data methodologies, such as unsupervised learning, supervised learning, neural networks, causal inference, and A/B testing. 

I use this combination of tooling and concepts in a number of business contexts to produce positive revenue, customer sentiment, and data-driven outcomes. I am comfortable actively managing both technical and non-technical relationships, as well as collaborating across teams with varied stakeholders.

Don't hesitate to reach out with any questions!
