I am a data professional with 9+ years of experience in the vertical. My specialty lies within app and web environments, with a focus on product and marketing analytics. Specifically, I have vast experience with platform architecture & implementation, data visualization & analysis, and experimentation & optimization.

I have comprehensive exposure to a number of data tools, including but not limited to: Google Analytics, Amplitude, Mixpanel, Google Tag Manager, Segment, BigQuery, Snowflake, Tableau, and Looker. Additionally, I have an intimate understanding of a variety of data methodologies, such as machine learning (unsupervised, supervised, neural networks) and statistical analysis (t-tests, regression, correlation, causal inference, etc). I am able to apply this combination of tooling and concepts in a number of business contexts to produce positive revenue-driving and customer-sentiment outcomes.

I regularly leverage SQL, Python, and JavaScript to facilitate data collection, transformation, and aggregation to promote data democratization and data-driven decision making. I am comfortable actively managing both technical and non-technical relationships, as well as collaborating across teams with varied stakeholders.

Don't hesitate to reach out with any questions!
